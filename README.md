# FinalCompo-MUSI4620-IK
- I wanted to do something that involves something musical, with a sequence of beats playing while also having something melodic play alongide as an accompaniment.
- As for the visual aspect, I want to map the sounds together with the objects in a sensible manner, such as mapping the percussion sounds to sudden movements and melodic sounds mapped to smoother movements, the latter which may be mapped to waveforms.
