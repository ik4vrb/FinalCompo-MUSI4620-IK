# FinalCompo-MUSI4620-IK

- Scene for final project: Test_IK

- I wanted to do something that involves something musical, with a sequence of beats playing while also having something melodic play alongide as an accompaniment.
- As for the visual aspect, I want to map the sounds together with the objects in a sensible manner, such as mapping the percussion sounds to sudden movements and melodic sounds mapped to smoother movements, the latter which may be mapped to waveforms.
- To add on to this final composition, I added spacial audio to two cubes on the sides with reverb to add more to the atmosphere of the sound composition I made.
- Along with that, I enabled certain objects to have directly modifiable parameters for interactive and experimental purposes.
- When it came to developing the overall composition of this work, I focused on figuring out a way to make the melody sound more interesting by expanding a bit on the pitches and enabling the user to modify the lfo and adsr values to get different variations of the sound while it plays its tune. The object that has is is the Osc Sphere.
- To add more to the table, I made the camera shake to give the sensation of the sound causing the environment to shake.
- My goal for this project was to implement some kind of visualization where the viewer can take a look at different shapes in the project and experiment with certain ones that have an impact on the overall sound of the composition being played.
- This project was intended to be more of an exploration of what can be done with various sequences of sounds and pitches, along with getting a sense of how certain things happen the way they do when the ideas come into fruition.
- What may be seen or heard may not be the most beautiful thing in the world, but for what it is, it is an experimental work that explores my curiosity and imagination into a realm of harmonic and visual randomness. As someoone who likes things in random fashion, this work interests me and I feel that I can do even more by better understanding how random can be something interesting if tamed in the right direction.
