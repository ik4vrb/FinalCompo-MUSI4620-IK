# FinalCompo-MUSI4620-IK

- Scene for final project: Test_IK

- I wanted to do something that involves something musical, with a sequence of beats playing while also having something melodic play alongide as an accompaniment.
- As for the visual aspect, I want to map the sounds together with the objects in a sensible manner, such as mapping the percussion sounds to sudden movements and melodic sounds mapped to smoother movements, the latter which may be mapped to waveforms.
- To add on to this final composition, I added spacial audio to two cubes on the sides with reverb to add more to the atmosphere of the sound composition I made.
- Along with that, I enabled certain objects to have directly modifiable parameters for interactive and experimental purposes.
